# Family-Leave-Challenge

***Challenge Objective***

For this challenge, you'll be working as a Data Visualization Specialist at an online business journal. Your role is to create charts, visuals, and infographics as supporting content for articles.
As part of Women's History Month in the United States, your company is writing a piece on parental leave policies across the business world and they need you to create an impactful visual using the data you collected.

***About The Data Set***

Crowdsourced parental leave data from 1,601 companies across different industries, including paid/unpaid maternity and paternity leave weeks.

- For few leaves column data value was 'N/A' which means no data was provided by companies. To format column data type as number, N/A was replaced by -1, so that while calculating Average/Total values these 'N/A' values could be filtered out.
